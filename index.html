        <h1>Animation</h1>
        I don't remember every animation Dr. B did, so I'll try to write about the ones that I remember.
        <br />
        <h3>Transition</h3>
        First, I think Dr. B used <code>.transition()</code> to make a changes visible. With <code>.duration()</code> to specify the duration for the transitions. Because all the transitions of each score change occurs in about the same time, I don't think Dr. B used <code>.delay()</code>. To make the transitions smooth, he used <code>.ease()</code> and maybe with <code>d3.easeLinear</code>
        <br />
        I don't remember if there is any special animation at the beginning and end of transition.
        <br />
        Dr. B probably used <code>mouseover</code> and <code>mouseout</code> to show the score on hover.
